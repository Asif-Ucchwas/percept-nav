# Percept-Nav Development Log

## Task 1 — Camera sensor (2026-07-18)
- Model: burger has no camera by default; found TurtleBot3 already ships a
  camera-equipped `burger_cam` model (SDF, not URDF — spawner reads model.sdf).
- Verified `/camera/image_raw` and `/camera/camera_info` publish real data.
- Issue: Gazebo Harmonic (OGRE-Next) gets no GPU accel through WSLg on this
  machine — falls back to software rendering (llvmpipe), ~3Hz instead of 30Hz.
- Fix: wrote a custom headless launch file (percept_nav_headless.launch.py)
  that drops the GUI client action — avoids the rendering bottleneck entirely
  since we don't need the live 3D view for development.

## Task 2 — OpenCV camera viewer node (2026-07-18)
- Confirmed OpenCV 4.6.0 + cv_bridge already installed, no install needed.
- Wrote camera_viewer_node.py: subscribes to /camera/image_raw, converts via
  cv_bridge, logs frame shape/timestamp, saves a sample frame to disk.
- Verified with 1700+ live frames processed. Frame size is 320x240 (wide-angle
  camera default), not 640x480 as originally assumed from the unused URDF edit.

## Task 3 — Obstacle detection, classical CV (2026-07-21, in progress)
- Approach: grayscale -> Gaussian blur -> Canny edge detection -> findContours
  -> filter by area -> bounding box. Deliberately classical CV, not deep
  learning (no training data needed, fast, fully explainable).
- Publishes annotated image on /camera/obstacle_detections for visual check.
